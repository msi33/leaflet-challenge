# leaflet-challenge

This is the Leaflet Earthquake Visualization Github Repo. The data used for visualization came from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The goal is to generate interactive maps using Leaflet.

Background
The USGS is tasked with gathering and providing scientific data related to natural hazards, ecosystem, environmental health as well as data related to impacts of climate and land utility changes. In order to achieve and communicate effectively there is interest to build new tools for earthquake visualization data. 

Repo Organization
The repo has several files that needed to create necessary visualizations. The files includes:
1. index.html: The main HTML document.
2. LeafLet-part-1/static
   js/logic.js: This has javascript code for fetching data and use that data to build vizualization.
   CSS/style.css: This has styling information for nicer vizualization
   Images: This has screenshots of images for the README.
   

Instruction
The project is divided into two parts
1. part 1 deals with creating Earthquake Visualization
2. part 2 deals with gathering and plotting more data (optional for challenge)


Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
The first activity was to visuzaliza an earthquake dataset following these steps
